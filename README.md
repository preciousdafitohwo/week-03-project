User Stories

1) I want to browse a set of thumbnail images that load quickly
2) I want to select a thumbnail and display a larger version of the image, with a description
3) I expect accessible considerations like alternative text for images, and the ability to click next and previous buttons using the keyboard


Requirements met and goals achieved for this project

1) i was able to set the thumbnail and the large container displaying a larger image on click
2) i wasnt able to make the buttons functional by adding a suitable event listener - which would allow navigation by keyboard or mouse click
3) since there was hardly any actually html elements in my html file, i struggled on what else i could do to increase accessibility, and i culdnt give my images tab indexes as they were imported from my js file.
